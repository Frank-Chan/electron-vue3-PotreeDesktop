PotreeConverter comprises a free and a paid part.

1. Non-commercial and non-government users may use and modify the 
source code and binaries for free.
This includes universities and research institutions as long as the 
application is not used for or part of a commercial product or service.
2. Commercial and government users may use and modify the 
source code and binaries after purchasing a commercial license. 
3. Commercial and government users may use PotreeConverer 
for free for three months, before deciding whether to purchase a license. 
4. Paid licenses are per simultaneously running instance. A single license 
may be used to install PotreeConverter on multiple devices of the licensee, 
as long as only one instance runs at a time. 
5. Anyone may redistribute source, binaries, and modifications of either, but 
redistributions and modifications must retain this LICENSE file and recipients 
are also subject to its conditions. The recipients must be made aware of the 
license conditions. If the recipient is a commercial or government user, 
then the recipient must also purchase a license. 

Exceptions: If you feel that the terms above don't fit your use case or that you 
can't afford a paid license for your project (e.g., art, indie, ...), 
feel free to inquire for different terms or exceptions at licensing@potree.org. 
Note that the first three months are free in any case.
